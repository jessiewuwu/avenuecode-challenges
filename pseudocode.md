- come up with a wireframe
- Implement Snazzy Map
- Responsive Design with media queries
- use SASS
- Testing: 80%+ on the features
- create the README.md



## SEARCH FORM
- Add an area for the search form
- Add a search form and prevent default for the submit button
- On click, take the value inside of the form and use the API



## Company Location + My Location
# have an array to hold both locations:
  # var locations = [['company location', lat, long], ['user location', lat, long]]
# If Locate button is clicked
  # Company Location Map shows up
  # shove the lat and long into array[0]
    # when Locate button is clicked, shove the array of lat and long into the array[0][1] and array[0][2]
# If My Location button is clicked
  # User's Location Map shows up
    # shove the long and long into array[1]
       # when My Location button is clicked, shove that array of lat and log into the array[1][1] and array[1][2]
# If Locate button --> My Location button are clicked
  # Both pins show up in the center of the range on the map
# when Reset button is clicked, the User pin disappears
  # delete the values inside array[1]: ['user location', lat, long] to ['user location']



## BUGS
1. Given two locations, the map only focuses on the location last clicked.
2. The GeoIP API doesn't give an exact latitude and longitude because it rounds up after the tenth decimal, which makes the location inaccurate by a few blocks.
  * Possible Solution - find a better API that gives exact latitude and longitude
  * Possible Solution - instead of using a pinpoint, use a circle range to cover a broad area (about 5x5 block radius).
3. After clicking Reset Location, the Map pinpoints the ocean. Instead, it should zoom out and center on the entire United States.
